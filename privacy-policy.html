                    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                    
                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how SkillScanr, a British private limited company based in Gloucestershire, UK, collects, uses, and protects your personal data when you register your interest in our upcoming Applicant Tracking System (ATS) service (also referred to as 'Hiring Portal') and/or Candidate Portal. When we refer to "SkillScanr," "we," "our," or "us," we mean SkillScanr, the entity acting as the 'controller' of your personal data under the UK General Data Protection Regulation ("UK GDPR").</p>
                    
                    <p>By "you," we mean the individual providing their name and email address to register interest in our service. "Personal Data" refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, as defined by the UK GDPR. This Policy applies only to the collection and processing of names and email addresses through our website at skillscanr.com and does not cover other parties' products, services, or websites.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                    <p>We collect the following Personal Data when you register your interest in our service:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Name:</strong> Provided by you to identify you when you sign up to receive updates about our upcoming ATS (for recruiters) or candidate portal (for candidates).</li>
                        <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> Provided by you to send you updates about our upcoming ATS service.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We may also collect anonymous, non-personal data, such as website usage statistics, which does not identify you and is not covered by this Policy.</p>
                    
                    <h2>How We Use Your Personal Data</h2>
                    <p>We process your name and email address for the following purposes:</p>
                    
                    <h3>To Send Updates</h3>
                    <p>To inform you about the development and launch of our ATS (for recruiters) or candidate portal (for candidates), including promotional and informational messages about SkillScanr, addressing you by name for personalized communication.</p>
                    <p><strong>Legal Ground:</strong> Consent (UK GDPR Article 6(1)(a)). By providing your name and email address, you consent to receiving these updates.</p>
                    
                    <h3>To Comply with Legal Obligations</h3>
                    <p>To meet any applicable legal or regulatory requirements, such as record-keeping for tax or auditing purposes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Legal Ground:</strong> Legal obligation (UK GDPR Article 6(1)(c)).</p>
                    
                    <h3>To Improve Our Services</h3>
                    <p>To analyze aggregated, anonymized data to understand user interest and improve our website and future service offerings.</p>
                    <p><strong>Legal Ground:</strong> Legitimate interests (UK GDPR Article 6(1)(f)). Our legitimate interest is to gauge interest in our service and enhance its development.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
                    <p>We may use cookies or similar technologies on our website to collect anonymous data about user interactions (e.g., page views, session duration). These do not collect Personal Data unless you provide your name or email address. You can manage cookie preferences through your browser settings, but disabling cookies may affect your experience on our website. We do not currently respond to "Do Not Track" signals.</p>
                    
                    <p>By using our website, you agree to our use of cookies as described. If you are using a device that is not your own, we assume you have the owner's authorization to agree to cookie usage.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Sharing Your Personal Data</h2>
                    <p>We do not share your name or email address with third parties, except in the following cases:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may engage third-party service providers (e.g., email marketing platforms) to send updates on our behalf. These providers act as 'processors' and are contractually obligated to protect your data in accordance with UK GDPR.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your Personal Data if required by law, regulation, or a judicial/administrative order, such as to comply with anti-money laundering or taxation requirements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or similar transaction, your Personal Data may be shared with relevant parties under standard confidentiality arrangements.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
                    <p>If we transfer your Personal Data outside the UK (e.g., to a service provider in the United States), we will ensure appropriate safeguards are in place, such as the UK's International Data Transfer Agreement, to ensure an adequate level of protection as required by UK GDPR.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Data Security</h2>
                    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss, alteration, or destruction. However, no security measure is foolproof, and we cannot guarantee absolute safety during data transmission or storage.</p>
                    
                    <h2>How Long We Keep Your Data</h2>
                    <p>We retain your name and email address for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy (e.g., until the launch of our ATS service or you unsubscribe from updates) or as required by law (e.g., for tax or auditing purposes, typically up to seven years).</p>
                    
                    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
                    <p>As a 'data subject' under the UK GDPR, you have the following rights:</p>
